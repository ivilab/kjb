# Template for Makefile-2 for a library directory. Usually operated on by the
# script kjb_add_makefiles. 
#
# The directory that we are in should have a different name than any KJB library
# sub-dirs. 
#
# Replace 'l' with the directory name, and L with the upper case
# counterpart.  The string that replaces 'l' should not be a sub-dir of KJB
# library. 
#
# Then, DELETE this comment block, because it is no longer a template!

# We include $(MAKE_DIR)Makefile-defs once per compile, so this include belongs
# in Makefefile-2. Note that we rely on late binding of make variables, as
# the proper definition of symbols in $(MAKE_DIR)Makefile-defs require values in
# Makefile-libs-needed, which is included later.

# This is for the case that Makefile-dirs does not exist.
