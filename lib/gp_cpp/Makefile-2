# Template for Makefile-2 for a library directory. Usually operated on by the
# script kjb_add_makefiles. 
#
# The directory that we are in should have a different name than any KJB library
# sub-dirs. 
#
# Replace 'gp_cpp' with the directory name, and GP_CPP with the upper case
# counterpart.  The string that replaces 'gp_cpp' should not be a sub-dir of KJB
# library. 
#
# Then, DELETE this comment block, because it is no longer a template!
