The input to qhull appears to be less than 3 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p88 (v3):   0.9  0.28  -9.6
- p91 (v2):   -16   -18    11
- p89 (v1):    16   9.1    -8
- p90 (v0):   -27   -23   6.3

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 2e-05.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point p-2:    -6.632    -8.01  0.03145

facet p91 p89 p90 distance= -5e-07
facet p88 p89 p90 distance= -4.5e-07
facet p88 p91 p90 distance= -5.1e-07
facet p88 p91 p89 distance= -2.6e-08

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:    -27.29     15.72  difference= 43.01
  1:    -23.42     9.085  difference= 32.5
  2:    -9.626     11.37  difference= 20.99

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use the 'Qs' flag to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En' to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 2e-05.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.
  - recompile qhull for double precision (#define REALfloat 0 in qhull.h).

If the input is lower dimensional:
   - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
     pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
     correct topology.
   - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
     into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
   - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.
