This directory contains C code used for geodesy and for caching aerial imagery.
The primary authors are Scott and Alan Morris, although Andrew Predoehl helped
adapt it to libkjb conventions, though that aspect still needs more work.
Both are used by the Finding Trails project.  File master.c contains geodesy
code, code that models the earth as an ellipsoid, and computes great circle
distances on that surface.  File index.c contains code used for developing a
file cache of tiled aerial imagery.  It's primarily used with TerraServer
imagery.
