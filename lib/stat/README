This directory contains fancy stat routines. It forces the loading of external
libraries such as gsl.

It should *not* be used for simple calculations such as means, variances, and
normal distribution. Such things are currently in the "m" library, and should be
maintained/improved there. Otherwise we will be linking against external
routines un-necessarily.
