# Uncomment and modify the following lines to add include directory search

# those that the build scripts want to use, and HACK_AFTER_INCLUDES specifies
# locations that are checked last.  (HACK_AFTER_INCLUDES is far less likely to
# cause problems). At UA, this mechanism should be used only as a temporary
# measure to figure out what works. As soon as it is clear what is needed, we
# should fix init_compile and comment out these variabile settings. Pretending
# that this is where you hack things to make them work and then forgetting about
# it has lead to build bugs.
